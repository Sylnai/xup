""" $Id: filetail.py 1512 2011-05-20 16:14:29Z morrissj $

Python3 module for tailing a file such as a system log that grows continuously.
Transparently handles files that get rotated or trucated.
Inspired by the Perl File::Tail module.

A simple algorithm is used to dynamically sleep when no new data is available in
the file. The longer the amount of time goes by w/o new data the longer the
sleep interval will be (up to "max_interval") and starts at "interval".

Example:
    from filetail import FileTail
    tail = FileTail("/var/log/syslog")
    for line in tail:
        # do something
        pass
